1. **Batch** (The Container)  Holds multiple simulations.
2. **Time** (The Sequence)  Holds the history steps.
3. **Nodes** (The Graph)  Holds the map locations.
4. **Features** (The Data)  Holds the actual numbers (speed, etc.).

Now, here is the "magic" of why we need **ST-Mamba** (Spatio-Temporal Mamba) specifically. It’s because standard models can only look in **one direction** at a time.

### The "Two-Step Dance" of ST-Mamba

Since we have this nested structure, we need two different specialists to process it.

#### Step 1: The Spatial Specialist (GNN)

* **Where it looks:** It opens **one single Time folder** and looks at all the **Nodes** inside it.
* **The Job:** It connects the dots on the map.
* *Example:* "Oh, Node A is congested. Node B is connected to Node A, so Node B will likely get congested too."


* **The Transformation:** It takes the complex map of nodes and summarizes it into a "Graph Embedding."
* *Input:* `[Nodes, Features]` (Detailed Map)
* *Output:* `[Hidden_Dim]` (Summary of the Traffic State at this second)



#### Step 2: The Temporal Specialist (Mamba)

* **Where it looks:** It ignores the nodes (because the GNN already handled them). It looks **across the Time folders**.
* **The Job:** It connects the past to the future.
* *Example:* "At Time 1 traffic was low. At Time 2 it rose quickly. Therefore, at Time 3 it will peak."


* **The Transformation:** It takes the sequence of summaries and predicts the next one.

### Why this is brilliant for your "Project Newton"

If you tried to feed the raw 4D data into a normal Mamba, it would get confused. It would see "Node 1 at Time 1" and "Node 2 at Time 1" as just a sequence of numbers, losing the fact that they are neighbors on a map.

By splitting it:

1. **GNN** solves the **Map** puzzle.
2. **Mamba** solves the **Time** puzzle.

Does this distinction between the "Inside the Folder" work (GNN) and the "Across the Folders" work (Mamba) make sense?
